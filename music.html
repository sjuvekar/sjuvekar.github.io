  I am an amateur keyboard player. Back in grad school, we had an amateur band and used to jam quite often. Too bad it didn't take off
  that well. But I picked up a lot of chords and piano fundaes from the guys in the band. I recorded some of my piece. Here are the youtube
  videos. They're a bit sketchy...I'm still working on them!! So, stay tuned!!

        <span class="greetings">Fur Elise </span>: Like most amateurs, this is the first piano piece I learned on my own.
