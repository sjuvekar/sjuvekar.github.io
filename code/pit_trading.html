				Pit Trading is a fun and informative game, most useful for teaching trading to a complete newbie. Here is how it works in a simulated market:
			</p>
			<ul class="iphone-app-text">
				<li> Every trader has a smart-phone with Pit Trading installed on it. </li>
				<li> The app keeps a list of all market-makers. </li>		
				<li> A trader goes to the market-makers to trade and clicks the row corrresponding to him in the app. This brings up the trading screen as shown here. </li>
				<li> The trader and market-maker fill the trading information, including price and side on the form. This completes the trade. </li>
				<li> The app keeps the list of all previous trades executed by a trader and adds them all to find his/her PNL at the end of trading session. </li>
			</ul>
			<p class="iphone-app-text"> 
				The app is not on the store. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sjuvekar/PitTrading">Github</a>. Click the images below to download the code.
