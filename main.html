<span class="greetings">Hi, Howdy, Namaste and Welcome,</span>
<p>
  My name is Sudeep Juvekar. I am an quantitative analyst <span class="emphasize">("Quant")</span>, photographer, musician, researcher
  and a consummate geek! I am more of an amateur in everything I do and I really love doing it!
</p>
<p>
  So, as I said, I am currently a quantitative analyst at a hedge fund on Wall Street, NY. Before that, 
  I was a <a href = "images/salaries.gif" target = "none"> poor graduate student </a>
  at the Department of Electrical Engineering, UC Berkeley. Before that, I was a <a href="images/wing.jpg" target = "none">happy- 
    go-lucky undergrad </a>
  at IIT Bombay. Before that, well, that's an era bygone!
</p>
<p>
  Well, one of the guys in the picture is me, the other being my alter-ego, the nameless hero 
  from <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com" target="none">PhD comics</a>. The remaining are photos taken 
  by one of the guys in the picture. Go figure!
